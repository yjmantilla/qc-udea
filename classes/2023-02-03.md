## Complejidad Computacional

- Para medir el tiempo de ejecucion independiente de la plataforma
- Big O notation
- Grafica de distintos tipos de complejidad computacional

## Common types

- Constant : O(1)
- Linear : O(n)
- Logarithmic : O(log n)
- Quadratic : O(n**2)

## O(1) Constant Time

- Always same time no matter n number of elements
- Example: Access 1 value in an array of N elements
- No matter the element, we take the same to retrieve that position
- Other ones: push() and pop() take de same time --> Why, if you push N elements dont you need N operations to move in memory? --> Ans: Assuming it operates on a single element at a time. Dont even have a concept of "N" elements.

## O(n) Linear Time

- Operations is proportional to number of elements
- Example: Find an element in array

## O(log n) Logarithmic Time

- Faster than Linear
- Example: Binary Search (on a sorted array?)
- Example: Iterate one every two elements

## O(n**2) Quadratic Time

- Bubble sort
- Typical: Algorithms with 2 nested fors, each N--> N*2 for the combinations
- Example: Find duplicates in a deck of cards
- Can be managed with classical computers still

## O(n**m)

- M nested loops

## Factorization

- O(N=2**n) --> Goes with the size in bits of the number
- Exponential Time Complexity
- Example --> N=10 --> 10 <= 2**4 = 16
- In general O(N=A**n)

## Important Note

- The input is either the number of elements
- Or the size (as in bits, or coding length) of the element

## Quantum Jump

### Shor Algorithm

- Factorization is O(n**3) in quantum computing vs O(2**n) in classical computing (using super computers)
- Not even Moore's Law in its optimal form could sabe us
- Page : Quantum Algorithm Zoo

Even with that, QC only solves some problems. NP-Hard is still hard.

## Quantum Architecture

- The architecture depends on the underlying technology.
- How does Quantum Architecture Looks?

### As of now

- Quantum computers are a mix of classical and quantum tech.
- Program data is still classical
- A quantum algorithm uses both classical and quantum data
- There is a "Quantum Computer Controller" that interafaces with a classical computer.

- Python code is translated to signals that control the Quantum Computer

#### Quantum Von Neumann architecture

- Quantum memory still too raw
- We are still missing the Quantum Bus System
- Quantum ALU is aceptable
- Input/Output still raw too

#### Quantum Assembler (QASM)

Think of "quantum gates" as instructions in a classical computer. Note: Rather than the gates I think he regers to the "quantum" instruction architecture.

The Control Unit translates the QASM instruction set to concrete physical operations, which depends on the underlying technology (laser, or whatnot).

The classical controller holds the program.

#### Input/Output

Problem is the stability of the qbits. Because of coherence/decoherence, stability is of seconds.

#### Performance

- Whats the "clock speed"

#### Design Layers of a Quantum Computer and a Quantum Algorithm

Quantum Error Correction (QEC): Deal with the underlying quantum technology inestability. Coherence time of qbits is extremely short.

Full Tolerance: Tolerance to failures. This is also seen in Real Time Systems. Either classical or quantum.

```python
Quantum Programming can be done in Colombia.
We have talent.
Even if there is no Quantum Computer available.
What we do in quantum programming may be extremely valuable.
```

#### Main Idea

- Abstracted Layers from Low to High Level.
- As users we should work with high-level
- Low-level should work to what we did in the high-level
- High-level should be low-level agnostic

IBM Quantum Awards:
Open Science Prize 2022
IBM Quantum is excited to announce the third annual Open Science Prizeâ€”an award for the best open source solution to some of the most pressing problems in the field of quantum computing. This year, the Prize will demand a high accuracy variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) computation of a kagome spin lattice. The best open source solution will receive a $30,000 prize. The runner up will receive $20,000.

Registration is open through mid-April after which judges will review the submissions and announce the winners. For more information on the contest rules, judging criteria, and problem walk through (a Jupyter notebook) check out the GitHub repo or join the conversation #open-science-prize-22.
